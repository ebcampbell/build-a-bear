# Build-A-Bear
**Created by:** [Erin Campbell](https://github.com/ebcampbell) and [Tanisha L. Davey](https://github.com/tanishalatoya)

### Description:
In this application, on initial use a user is encounters an "undressed" bear with several button options that allows the user to dress the bear up as desired. Additionally, there is a section of buttons that can change the bear's background upon the associated button click. Once a user has dressed the bear to their liking, the user can then save the outfit created by naming their outfit and clicking the save button. This then creates a card holding the clothing selections and/or background selection chosen by the user. The cards persist on page refresh and when a user closes the browser and then reopens it back up to the application, using the browser's local storage. Thus, a user can then click any of their saved cards to redress the bear in the outfit associated with the card. A user is also able to delete any or all of their outfit cards as needed.

### Here are some screenshot of our application:

* **Future iteration:** In the container containing the cards with the bear's saved outfits, a `clear all button` can be implemented to remove all the saved outfits simultaneously. This would remove the key associated with the array holding all the saved outfit cards from the browser's local storage.

* **Future iteration:** In the container containing the cards with the bear's saved outfits, the cards can be prepended to display the last saved outfit first.
